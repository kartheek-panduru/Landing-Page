        <h2><b>UI & UX</b></h2>
        <p>UX design refers to the term user experience design, while UI stands for "user interface design". Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different aspects of the product development process and the design discipline. 
            Essentially, UX applies to anything that can be experienced—be it a website, a coffee machine, or a visit to the supermarket. The "user experience" part refers to the interaction between the user and a product or service. User experience design, then, considers all the different elements that shape this experience. A UX designer thinks about how the experience makes the user feel, and how easy it is for the user to accomplish their desired tasks.</p>

            <h3>UI</h3>
            User interface (UI) is anything a user may interact with to use a digital product or service. This includes everything from screens and touchscreens, keyboards, sounds, and even lights. To understand the evolution of UI, however, it’s helpful to learn a bit more about its history and how it has evolved into best practices and a profession.

            <h3>UX</h3>
            User experience, or UX, evolved as a result of the improvements to UI. Once there was something for users to interact with, their experience, whether positive, negative, or neutral, changed how users felt about those interactions.
